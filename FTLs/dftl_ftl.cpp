/* Implementation of the DFTL described in the paper
 * "DFTL: A Flasg Translation Layer Employing Demand-based Selective Caching og Page-level Address Mappings"
 *
 * Notice: Startup procedures are not implemented as the drive is empty every time
 * the simulator is executed. i.e. OOB's is not filled with logical page address
 * at write and it is not read on startup to recreate mapping tables.
